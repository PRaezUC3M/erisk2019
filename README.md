# erisk2019
This repository reflects the efforts put into ERisk2019 tasks from HULAT.

This repository counts with all the .ipynb files in order to train the different 5 approaches that were taken.
As well as the best model fine-tuned configuration found for them. 

Even so, it lacks some files due to file size limitation, like the following:

- Data provided by the challenge.
- Embeddings used.
